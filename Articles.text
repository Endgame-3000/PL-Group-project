German banks cool on UK office lending as Brexit chaos bites
German banks’ share of the UK commercial real-estate lending market shrank in the first half of the year as Brexit uncertainty took its toll.
Lenders such as Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG may not be household names in Britain, but they’ve long been major issuers of loans to office builders and warehouse owners. German lenders accounted for 8% of new loans in the first half, down from 12% a year earlier and 16.7% in the first half of 2016, before the UK voted to leave the European Union, according to Nicole Lux, author of a survey conducted by the Cass Business School.
The UK commercial property market has been blighted by Brexit uncertainty this year, with sellers waiting for clarity after two missed deadlines for the country to leave the EU. That has damped deal-making even as buyers remain hungry for trophy properties and development sites. The wide discount for UK assets compared with other western European countries, combined with a relative lack of new construction, has buoyed demand.
“For German lenders it is really the Brexit problem,” Lux said in a telephone interview. “Other international lenders don’t seem to have the same view, but the German bank head offices want to hold off.”
German banks issued 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) of loans secured by commercial real estate in the first half, down from 2.6 billion pounds in the year-earlier period, Lux said.
While loan issuance was up 4% in the first half to 23.3 billion pounds, 62% of those loans were related to refinancing, the survey found. Crashing mall values and WeWork’s uncertain impact on the office market are also causing concern among all lenders.

World’s first major co-living fund seeks $825 million in pledges
Real estate investment manager DTZ Investors and co-living developer the Collective have started the world’s first fund to buy and build communal housing in London, betting lonely renters and sky-high house prices will make the niche sector mainstream.
The venture is seeking 650 million pounds ($825 million) in commitments and plans to invest in six to 10 projects in London, according to a statement Monday. The fund has 70 million pounds of seed capital and its managers aim to build a portfolio valued at about 1 billion pounds over its 10-year life, with returns of 8% to 10%.
“We definitely expect a first-mover advantage,” Chris Cooper, chief executive officer of DTZ Investors, said in an interview. The fund manager invested in UK student-housing landlord Unite Group Plc in 2005, a time when purpose-built apartments for students were in their infancy. That bet has paid off handsomely.
Co-living developments provide small bedrooms or apartments with large common areas, selling customers on a sense of community and access to a wide range of amenities. The handful of brands emerging in the UK and US typically target young professionals who are priced out of buying their own homes.
The fund’s first investment is a 222-room building in London’s Harrow section that’s due to be completed in 2021. As well as funding new projects, the venture, called COLIV, will buy existing properties that have been operated by the Collective during its four-year investment period.
Tiny rooms
The Collective currently has about 1,650 rooms and is in the process of developing 8,000 more in the UK, Ireland, Germany and the US, according to CEO Reza Merchant. The average age of its customers is 33 and the average yearly salary of tenants at its property in London’s Old Oak is about 34,000 pounds, he said.
Critics of co-living point to the relatively high rents charged for rooms that are much smaller than normal studios or one-bedroom apartments. Rates at the Collective’s Old Oak, in the West London Willesden Junction district, start at 1,083 pounds a month for a room designed for one person when rented on a 12-month contract, according to its website.
“We are very focused on the quality of the space we design, and by sharing, you get access to so much more,” Merchant said. The company runs events designed to combat loneliness and bring people together, while its buildings have amenities ranging from cinemas, libraries, spas and, in the case of the Collective’s Canary Wharf site, a rooftop swimming pool.
“Financial return is a very important objective,” he said, “but for us as a business, we want to have a positive social impact.”

Housing society can’t be forced to participate in cluster development: Bombay HC
The Bombay high court on Friday said a co-operative housing society cannot be forced to participate in any development project without its lawful consent, based on a resolution of its properly constituted general body meeting.
The division bench of justice SC Dharmadhikari and justice Gautam Patel said it was wholly impermissible to include property of such a society in any form of development, redevelopment or cluster development project without notice, without opportunity of hearing or without specific consent of the society, based on lawful resolution appropriately carried at its properly convened general body meeting.
The bench was hearing a petition filed by Jawahar Jyoti co-operative housing society at Panchpakhadi in Thane challenging resolution passed Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) in its general body meeting on December 10, 2018.
The resolution included property of the petitioner society in a cluster development project, although its name did not find a place in any of the 44 urban renewal projects published by the civic body till then.
The society contended that its name was included in a cluster development project only on suggestion of two adjoining housing societies, Rajtara co-operative housing society and Garodia co-operative housing society, both of which have been included in the cluster development project.
The petitioner society’s lawyer, advocate Neeta Karnik, pointed out that its forcible inclusion in the cluster development project would impose unwarranted restrictions on its ownership right over its own property and therefore the resolution was liable to be struck down.
In its reply to the petition, TMC conceded the name of Jawahar Jyoti co-operative housing society was included in the cluster development scheme on a suggestion given by the neighbouring societies, and stated the petitioner society was free to develop its property on its own, if it did not want to participate in the cluster development project and take its benefit.
The bench accepted the statement but clarified that no one can dictate to the petitioner society how their property should be developed or redeveloped or in what proposal or project it should be included, save and except by its lawful consent.
It also clarified that the statement of the civic body meant that the petitioner society will not be included in the cluster development project and any application for development permissions by it will be considered on its own merit.

UP real estate authority goes online, e-courts to start from November
The Uttar Pradesh Real Estate Regulatory Authority( UP-Rera) is all set to start e-courts from November. Under the authority’s plan, a complainant will have come only once to the court at the time of final arguments before UP-Rera benches deliver the order. The move is expected to save time and facilitate speedy disposal of cases.
UP-Rera chairman Rajive Kumar said, “As of now, though we receive applications online, and during the hearings, complainants have to come several times to the UP-Rera to plead their case. Our plan is to introduce e-courts from November. Under this process, a complainant will have to come only at the final hearing stage.”
Explaining how the workings of the planned e-court system, Kumar said, “On receiving an online complaint, a builder will be asked to submit a reply and the reply will then be emailed to the complainant. After this, the complainant will file a counter reply or can come up with more pleadings. These replies or further pleadings will be emailed to the builder’s representative. On getting a response from the builder to the complainant’s queries, the complainant will be asked to file counter reply. Both builder and complainant will be asked to submit the evidence and supporting documents.”
“Once all documents and replies and counter replies are presented, the complainant and the builder representative will be called at UP-Rera court for a final hearing. Both parties will argue their cases, and the UP-Rera bench can then either issue an order the same day or reserve the order and then issue the order within next few days, and both parties will get a copy of the order. However, for getting a certified copy of the order, one will have to apply online and pay the prescribed fee,” Kumar added.
Officials said once the e-court system is introduced, all the new complaints will be processed under this system. “The system is expected to be very effective and time-saving and will help in speedy disposal of cases. The existing complaints will, however, be dealt with as per the present system,” Kumar said.
The move has been welcomed by some complainants as well. “Presently, in the first two or three hearings, the complainant and the builder only exchange replies. They also seek time to file replies to each other’s submissions. With the introduction of e-courts, these visits will not be needed and it will save our time and expenses spent on travelling too,” Anil Kumar, a complainant who had come to attend the hearing in his case before Bench 1 of the UP-Rera on Thursday.
Advocates too feel the e-court system will help in speedy disposal of cases.  “Right now we need to visit the court at least three to four times before a judgement is reserved. Each date falls in a gap of roughly one month. With e-courts at least two visits, which means almost two month’s time will be saved and will expedite resolution of cases,”  Manish Kumar, partner, Legal Sutrar, said.

Housing sales dips 18 per cent in July-September quarter across top 7 cities: Report
Housing sales declined 18 per cent to 55,080 units during the July-September period across seven major cities as buyers were cautious in making property investments, according to real estate services firm Anarock.
Housing sales stood at 67,140 units in the year-ago period across seven cities --- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai metropolitan region, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad.
“Around 55,080 units were sold in Q3 2019 – a decline of 20 per cent over Q2 2019, and a 18 per cent year-on-year decline,” property consultant Anarock said in a report.
Apart from low sentiments, Anarock attributed the fall in housing sales to ban on subvention scheme and inauspicious ‘shraadh’ period.
 “The decline in new supply and housing sales in this quarter was expected as both homebuyers and developers remained cautious and risk-averse,” said Anuj Puri, Chairman – Anarock.
However, he said the slew of economy-boosting measures by the government to spur growth across sectors would boost housing demand in the festive season and in the ensuing quarters going forward.
 “As evidenced by the quick revival of the stock markets, these measures have already bolstered all-round sentiment. Housing is intensely sentiment-driven and we expect the numbers to improve significantly going forward,” Puri said.
The recent corporate tax cut will spur investments from both domestic and foreign investors, he added.
 As per the data, housing sales fell in each of the seven cities tracked by Anarock.
Bengaluru saw the maximum decline of 35 per cent to 10,500 units, followed by Hyderabad that witnessed 32 per cent drop at 3,280 units.
Housing sales in Kolkata went down by 27 per cent to 3,120 units, while demand was low by 13 per cent in the national capital region at 9,830 units.
Chennai reported an 11 per cent decline at 2,620 units, while Pune clocked 8 per cent dip to 8,550 units.
Housing sales in the Mumbai metropolitan region fell by 6 per cent to 17,180 units during July-September period of this year, compared to the year ago period.
 Unsold housing stock currently stood at 6.56 lakh units across the top 7 cities, a marginal decline from 6.66 lakh units at the end of June quarter.

Brexit takes wrecking ball to British housing market
As Britain’s deadline to leave the European Union approaches, property prices have slowed or dropped, especially in London, with sector analysts warning of worse to come if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal.
“The market is at a standstill,” said Beatrice Caboche, director at real estate company Barnes UK.
Average property sales prices rose just 0.7 percent in July, their slowest increase in nearly seven years.
Analysts blame a process set in motion with a 2016 Brexit referendum.
“Over the past three years, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.
Many investors expect the market to weaken further and don’t want to overpay for property that will be worth less if, for example, Britain leaves the EU without a negotiated deal.
Potential sellers, on the other hand, often prefer to leave their houses empty rather than accept a price they deem too low -- a stance that seems to add to an already acute housing crisis.
Decade-low
In London, property values dropped by four percent in the first quarter from their year-earlier level, the sharpest drop since 2009 when the global financial crisis was raging.
In wealthy London neighbourhoods, like Mayfair, Knightsbridge or South Kensington, the price falls have been most spectacular as they plunged from the dizzying heights of recent years.
“Transactions of high-end homes in central London last year reached a decade low,” according to data group LonRes, which said that the market had already been under pressure from stamp duty changes.
A property put on the market for 14 million pounds ($17.2 million, 15.7 million euros) four years ago could be sold now for nine million, said Caboche.
She said it’s not just the market’s high end that is suffering but the Brexit impact is being felt among cheaper housing, too, and across the entire country, with perhaps more of a lasting impact than even the financial crisis.
“This time around, prices have been falling more slowly, but continuously, and we don’t see any coming recovery,” she said.
Buyer’s market
Meanwhile, the sales commissions collected by estate agents have been dropping as transaction numbers fall, causing a bad mood in the profession.
But there’s a flipside to the suffering of sellers and middlemen: Some buyers are finding that the property market, which had priced them out a long time ago, has again become accessible.
Moreover, historically-low interest rates are an enticing proposition for anyone shopping for a mortgage.
Meanwhile, the decline of the pound, which is trading around 20 percent lower against the dollar than before the Brexit referendum, has vastly improved the purchasing power of non-residents eyeing British property.   
“It’s a buyer’s market,” said Caboche.
Some call the slowdown a necessary correction after years of double-digit price growth, particularly in London which is one of the world’s most expensive cities.
Either way, “house price growth has reached its nadir,” said analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding they now expected a recovery in 2020 as “the housing market appears to be emerging gradually from the coma induced by Brexit uncertainty”.
The market could grow by more than one percent next year, they said, but only if a no-deal Brexit is averted.
But if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal on October 31, predicted KPMG, prices could fall by up to 7.5 percent next year.

Indiabulls issued notice by Delhi HC over alleged illegalities and violations
The Delhi High Court on Friday issued a notice to Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd, its subsidiaries and promoters while hearing a petition against the company alleging “illegalities and violations”.
The Division Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued the notice on allegations of misappropriation of funds by Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited.
The petition seeks a direction to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to conduct an investigation through the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) into the alleged irregularities into the financial affairs of Indiabulls.
The petition also sought direction to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) to investigate the financial affairs and also to direct a special audit of IBHFL. An inquiry by SEBI is also been sought.
It has been alleged that money being loaned out to corporate groups by IBHFL is public money as IBHFL had itself, in the past many years taken huge sums of loans from various public and private banks.
The round-tripping of funds by IBHFL and its promoters is in violation of the relevant laws and policy guidelines and they have also not disclosed sources thereof and their books of account also did not show the true state of affairs.
Indiabulls has issued a statement which states that the PIL filed by Citizens Whistle Blower Forum is a pack of lies motivated by vested interest and has been filed without any research even on publicly available records of the company.
Senior Counsel Mukul Rohtagi and Abhishek Singhvi argued for the Company stated that the false and fabricated allegations made against the Company in respect of loans granted to four business groups fall flat merely on the fact that 2 of these loans to business groups are fully closed with no outstanding dues and loans to 2 other business groups are secured loans granted in the normal course of business and are being serviced regularly as per repayments schedule.
Further, these 2 business groups have no loans or investments of any kind whatsoever in any promoter companies.

Indiabulls issued notice by Delhi HC over alleged illegalities and violations
The Delhi High Court on Friday issued a notice to Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd, its subsidiaries and promoters while hearing a petition against the company alleging “illegalities and violations”.
The Division Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued the notice on allegations of misappropriation of funds by Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited.
The petition seeks a direction to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to conduct an investigation through the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) into the alleged irregularities into the financial affairs of Indiabulls.
The petition also sought direction to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) to investigate the financial affairs and also to direct a special audit of IBHFL. An inquiry by SEBI is also been sought.
It has been alleged that money being loaned out to corporate groups by IBHFL is public money as IBHFL had itself, in the past many years taken huge sums of loans from various public and private banks.

India’s poshest areas? Data reveals Tardeo and other surprises
They say you’ve arrived once you own a home in Mumbai – the city of dreams is one of the world’s most expensive for real estate. There isn’t much room to grow, unless you’re growing vertically. And even then, some plots are more prized than others.
So it’s no surprise that when property analyst firm Anarock, released their list of the country’s most expensive neighbourhoods from 2013 to the first half of 2019, Mumbai featured prominently. The surprise was that Tardeo was considered the most expensive place to buy a new home, with an average price tag of Rs 56,200 per sq ft
Tardeo isn’t a better address than Worli, Prabhadevi or Lower Parel, it’s just that luxury homes are harder to find in that locality. Most new construction is on small plots occasionally made available by redevelopment. In seven years, only 1,100 premium units (with an average size of 1,690 sq ft) have been released for sale.
“The other factor that often drives up prices is the saturation of luxury amenities in a project,” says Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock. “However, when it comes to the resale luxury market, areas like Nepean Sea Road, Altamount Road and Cuffe Parade are a lot costlier than Tardeo.”
Pankaj Kapoor, managing director of the real-estate analytics firm Liases Foras, says that a neighbourhood plays a big role in determining the value of a home. “The expensive quotient comes from neighbourhood,” he says. “Demographic and geographical factors help make a locality expensive. But the product has to be high-end too.” 
TOP SPOTS
Across the rest of the city, new expensive enclaves include Worli and Mahalaxmi, where 2- and 3-bedroom apartments dominate. At these hyper-expensive luxury residential locations, property commands Rs 41,500 and Rs 40,000 per sq ft respectively. 
These luxury properties offer an unrestricted view of the race course and sea views, premium amenities like self-sufficient high-grade educational and healthcare institutions as well as hotels and fine dining restaurants and privacy.
In Tardeo, businessman and resident Sunil Sanghvi has seven flats in Sahakar Niwas. “We are a joint family and it made sense to get flats in the same building,” he says. They built on the home Sanghvi’s father bought in the building 35 years ago. “Five years back, we bought  a 1BHK for 48,000 per sq ft in the same building. One thing that I really like about Tardeo is the liveliness. There are huge shopping centres, markets and supermarkets, I see people everywhere at any point of time.”
COUNTRY SWEEP
Among the southern states, neighbourhoods in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore made it to the list. Nungambakkam, Egmore and Anna Nagar rank 4th, 5th and 7th respectively. But buyers in Chennai get possibly a better deal. The average built-up size of the premium units in Chennai is about 17% larger than those in MMR. In Chennai, luxury apartment sizes are in the range of 2,190-2,890 sq ft. These are prime areas where demand is high and supply is scarce.
“Even the most expensive areas in Bangalore and Hyderabad come across as relatively affordable when compared to Mumbai,” says Puri. “Also, these cities still have sufficient land for development, so land scarcity has not yet kicked in. When it does, areas in these two cities are likely to join the ranks of India’s most expensive residential locations.”
In the NCR, Delhi’s Karol Bagh comes in 6th and Golf Course Road ranks 9th, with an average price of Rs 12,500 to Rs 13,500 per sq ft Some of these projects come with roof-top cafés with spectacular views, observatory decks, restaurants, spas and various other luxury accoutrements.
Pune’s Koregaon Park ranks 8th on the list, while Alipore in Kolkata ranks 10th. Average prices for luxury homes in these two micro-markets are INR 12,500 per sq ft and INR 11,800 per sq ft respectively.

Shaped by the Metro: How connectivity boots real estate
In India, the Metro rail or mass rapid transit (MRT) system is usually hailed in a clutch of hopeful terms: Dream project, high-speed corridor, success story of urban mobility, Make In India achievement. But often, we overlook how these transport systems come to shape how and where we live.
New Metro links are changing the realty scene in Pune, Lucknow, Jaipur, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. As localities get better connected, cities are expanding their peripheries and developers have been cashing in on this infrastructure development.
The Metro has helped a small city like Jaipur improve its connectivity and overall infrastructure, says Santhosh Kumar, vice chairman at Anarock Property Consultants. “The Metro started operations here in 2015, and since then it has reduced traffic woes and regularised public transportation,” he points out. “For city dwellers as well as thousands of tourists who visit the heritage city, commuting used to be chaotic and unorganised. Now the Metro link has played a role in appreciating real estate values of areas such as Civil Lines, Shyam Nagar, Ram Nagar and Mansarovar in Jaipur.”
IMPACT ON TRACK
Connectivity is the sole factor that determines the success of the sector, says Abhinav Joshi, head of research at CBRE, a realty research firm. “The entire affordable-housing concept of the government will be a failure without MRTS. It is dependent on connectivity,” he says.
This is a strategic point for developers, he says. “Builders advertise their projects based on the proposed Metro link, adding premiums because a well-connected neighbourhood will get them more traction. The working population is especially attracted. This is done based on the market value 5 years down the line.”
Rentals at IT parks connected by the Metro today have higher rates. At DLF Cyber City in Gurugram, rentals stood at Rs 60-67 per sq ft in 2012-2016. Now with the Metro connectivity and new phase launching, the rentals start from Rs 110 to Rs 130 sq  ft per month, he explains. “Similarly in Bengaluru, with the Whitefield phase Metro under construction, there are 1000s of housing projects being launched, including luxury homes,” he says.
The Versova-Andheri stretch in Mumbai has seen 8%-10% appreciation in residential properties over a period of three years, says Ramesh Nair, CEO and country head – India at JLL, a real-estate advisory. “This happened mainly towards the east side, as traffic got eased on road and also access towards the commercial hub (Andheri East) became easy. The growth has been relatively good in this tight market. Andheri East is one of the locations that didn’t see slowdown in prices mainly because of Metro coming in and the infrastructure uplift.”
Similarly in Bengaluru, the average monthly rentals for a standard 2BHK house spread over 1,000 sq ft is currently Rs 18,000 in Whitefield, rising by 31% since 2014 when monthly rentals were Rs 13,700, explains Kumar.
Retailers also get a slice the perks. Following the Delhi model, Mumbai has witnessed tremendous development across the Metro routes. Malls are now being used by retailers – hypermarkets and food and beverage operators. Quite often these are now favourite meeting spots for college students and working professionals.
Meanwhile in Delhi, traditional retail high-streets such as Chandni Chowk and Karol Bagh have also seen improved footfall due to the presence of Metro connectivity, says Kumar.
If we take a closer look at prominent cities such as London, New York and Singapore, their urban models have been developed around an integrated connectivity system with MRTS, says Rahul Grover, CEO of Sai Estate Consultants. “The concept is still very new in India and with it comes integrated townships, IT parks and the way people spend time in commuting changes.”
LAST MILE HURDLES
However, we lack the point-to-point connectivity, says Grover. “Metro has to connect the prominent landmarks and commercial hubs. If your workplace is not near a Metro station, you often end up taking another mode of transport and that gets pointless.”
A trail of general issues follow during the construction phase of the Metro, say experts. There’s traffic congestion, followed by rise in pollution levels; challenges in land acquisition and hence, the execution takes many years.
One interesting point is that, unlike residential projects that can hike their prices based on proposed Metro links, the office spaces reap the benefits only after the Metro line is functional, points out Joshi. With the current economic slowdown, Metros across cities could take more time for their completion and along with it, the projects near them could get delayed, speculates Grover.

Housing sales dips 18 per cent in July-September quarter across top 7 cities: Report
Housing sales declined 18 per cent to 55,080 units during the July-September period across seven major cities as buyers were cautious in making property investments, according to real estate services firm Anarock.
Housing sales stood at 67,140 units in the year-ago period across seven cities --- Delhi-NCR, Mumbai metropolitan region, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad.
“Around 55,080 units were sold in Q3 2019 – a decline of 20 per cent over Q2 2019, and a 18 per cent year-on-year decline,” property consultant Anarock said in a report.
Apart from low sentiments, Anarock attributed the fall in housing sales to ban on subvention scheme and inauspicious ‘shraadh’ period.
 “The decline in new supply and housing sales in this quarter was expected as both homebuyers and developers remained cautious and risk-averse,” said Anuj Puri, Chairman – Anarock.
However, he said the slew of economy-boosting measures by the government to spur growth across sectors would boost housing demand in the festive season and in the ensuing quarters going forward.
 “As evidenced by the quick revival of the stock markets, these measures have already bolstered all-round sentiment. Housing is intensely sentiment-driven and we expect the numbers to improve significantly going forward,” Puri said.
The recent corporate tax cut will spur investments from both domestic and foreign investors, he added.
 As per the data, housing sales fell in each of the seven cities tracked by Anarock.
Bengaluru saw the maximum decline of 35 per cent to 10,500 units, followed by Hyderabad that witnessed 32 per cent drop at 3,280 units.
Housing sales in Kolkata went down by 27 per cent to 3,120 units, while demand was low by 13 per cent in the national capital region at 9,830 units.
Chennai reported an 11 per cent decline at 2,620 units, while Pune clocked 8 per cent dip to 8,550 units.
Housing sales in the Mumbai metropolitan region fell by 6 per cent to 17,180 units during July-September period of this year, compared to the year ago period.
 Unsold housing stock currently stood at 6.56 lakh units across the top 7 cities, a marginal decline from 6.66 lakh units at the end of June quarter.

Brexit takes wrecking ball to British housing market
As Britain’s deadline to leave the European Union approaches, property prices have slowed or dropped, especially in London, with sector analysts warning of worse to come if Britain crashes out of the bloc without a deal.
“The market is at a standstill,” said Beatrice Caboche, director at real estate company Barnes UK.
Average property sales prices rose just 0.7 percent in July, their slowest increase in nearly seven years.
Analysts blame a process set in motion with a 2016 Brexit referendum.
“Over the past three years, there has been a general slowdown in UK house price growth, driven mainly by a slowdown in the south and east of England,” said Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK.
Many investors expect the market to weaken further and don’t want to overpay for property that will be worth less if, for example, Britain leaves the EU without a negotiated deal.
Potential sellers, on the other hand, often prefer to leave their houses empty rather than accept a price they deem too low -- a stance that seems to add to an already acute housing crisis.
Decade-low
In London, property values dropped by four percent in the first quarter from their year-earlier level, the sharpest drop since 2009 when the global financial crisis was raging.
In wealthy London neighbourhoods, like Mayfair, Knightsbridge or South Kensington, the price falls have been most spectacular as they plunged from the dizzying heights of recent years.
“Transactions of high-end homes in central London last year reached a decade low,” according to data group LonRes, which said that the market had already been under pressure from stamp duty changes.
A property put on the market for 14 million pounds ($17.2 million, 15.7 million euros) four years ago could be sold now for nine million, said Caboche.
She said it’s not just the market’s high end that is suffering but the Brexit impact is being felt among cheaper housing, too, and across the entire country, with perhaps more of a lasting impact than even the financial crisis.
“This time around, prices have been falling more slowly, but continuously, and we don’t see any coming recovery,” she said.
Buyer’s market
Meanwhile, the sales commissions collected by estate agents have been dropping as transaction numbers fall, causing a bad mood in the profession.
But there’s a flipside to the suffering of sellers and middlemen: Some buyers are finding that the property market, which had priced them out a long time ago, has again become accessible.
Moreover, historically-low interest rates are an enticing proposition for anyone shopping for a mortgage.
Meanwhile, the decline of the pound, which is trading around 20 percent lower against the dollar than before the Brexit referendum, has vastly improved the purchasing power of non-residents eyeing British property.   
“It’s a buyer’s market,” said Caboche.
Some call the slowdown a necessary correction after years of double-digit price growth, particularly in London which is one of the world’s most expensive cities.
Either way, “house price growth has reached its nadir,” said analysts at Pantheon Macroeconomics, adding they now expected a recovery in 2020 as “the housing market appears to be emerging gradually from the coma induced by Brexit uncertainty”.
The market could grow by more than one percent next year, they said, but only if a no-deal Brexit is averted.
But if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal on October 31, predicted KPMG, prices could fall by up to 7.5 percent next year.

Residents go with the flow, use smart tech to save water
Water conservation begins at home, in your apartment complex and colonies. You can start with something as simple as installing a low-flow water aerator on taps and showerheads, or recycle waste water to use for gardening, flushing and other quotidian household needs. 
As cities continue to urbanise, demand for fresh water is increasing, it’s hard to keep up supply. Civic bodies do not have adequate water infrastructure, climate change has led to erratic weather patterns. Combine that with mismanaged water resources, wasteful water policies and we have a looming water crisis. 
Waking up to this situation, many residential colonies and individual homes in India are using technology to save water. They are installing smart water meters to track water usage, installing waste-water treatment plants to recycle water in their societies and are even making drinking water out of thin air. 
Flowing uphill
“There are only two ways to solve the water problem,” says Abilash Haridass, co-founder and chief of growth and strategy, WEGoT Utility Solutions. “Either you increase the supply of water or you decrease the demand.” One way to reduce demand is by using water sensors to keep track of water consumption in each household.
In 2017, Bengaluru’s Pearl Tuscany complex, installed WEGoT’s VenAqua water sensor in its 48 apartments. The Chennai-based startup installed sensors in the water inlet of each apartment, helping homes to manage the entire water intake and use by analysing data to track flow, pressure and quality of water in real-time through an mobile phone application.
“The platform can detect leakages and we can remotely shut taps and valves off from our mobile phones. It also tracks abnormal consumption like drips and fixture efficiency and helps buildings become more water efficient,” says Venkatesan Natesan, secretary of the society. He says that their monthly maintenance bill has been reduced by 70 percent. “In 2018 we paid around Rs 2,000 per month, now we barely pay Rs 800 and save 35 percent of water too.” The meter is given out free of cost and residents pay a monthly subscription fee of Rs. 140 for the service. 
Similarly, Bengaluru-based Smarterhomes provides households in the city with meters to monitor water consumption using a remote sensing technology. At Celebrity Signature Apartments, residents have been heavily dependent on water tankers for the last 4-5 years. One major problem was dividing the tanker bill between its 80 regular flats and 11 penthouses in the building, as costs differed with the size of the home and varying number of people in each flat. “We tried multiple ways to implement a fair billing procedure, however, none of that worked,” says Melvin Vincent, president of the resident welfare association. “We then decided to install a smart meter because each resident can be billed as per use.” 
The most significant advantage says Vincent is that when people look at their own consumption data, they start taking conscious steps to optimise their consumption. The connected meters send consumption data in real time to the central analytical and billing engine. “The platform is accessible from smart phones, allowing users to view per inlet consumption, historical or average consumption or even make comparisons with their neighbours, which encourages them to reduce waste,” says Vivek Shukla, CEO Smarterhomes. 
Uncharted waters 
An innovative technology launched by Elbow Engineers Pvt LTD in December 2017, called My70 converts humidity in the air into drinking water. 
The device, which measures 3 feet by 1.5 feet, consists of a series of chambers, and runs on patented technology. It sucks the humidity from the atmosphere to create water which is then subject to a four-stage filtration process to produce clean water.
“Our domestic version produces 20 litres per day, which is the same as the bubble top can,” says Kumar Loganathan, CEO of the EWR. “The best advantage is the freedom from dependence on bottled water and other wasteful systems. Since our device requires no pipe connection and has no wastage, it scores over water starved areas that need RO systems,” says Gopikrishna, a resident of Chennai who uses this device in his home. The device is electrically powered and is usually kept running at night when the humidity is high. He says it produces water of a better quality than that supplied through the public systems.
Not going to waste 
Mumbai-based startup Indra Water helps residential societies save on their water costs by recycling their wastewater and reusing it for non-potable applications like flushing, gardening, car washing and landscaping. 
Indra installed a system at Somaiya Vidyavihar’s Maitreyi Hostel in March 2017. “We are saving around Rs 20,000 monthly on water bills,” says Mr. Gaurang Shetty, chief innovation catalyst at the institute’s Research Innovation Incubation Design Laboratory. “The system uses only electricity for treatment, no chemicals or biological medium is required. The technology is electrocoagulation.”
Since setting up, the hostel has managed recycle 7.5 lakh liters water per month, thereby reducing their demand for fresh water. The system status can be checked through a software dashboard and requires maintenance once every three months. It recycles 25,000 liters of wastewater per day taking up only25 sq.ft for installation and is currently being upgraded to a higher capacity. 
“The demand for water is going to double by 2030, as reported by NITI Ayog,” says Abhijit VVR, co-founder and chief of marketing and sales at the company. “With 54% of India being in water-stressed regions, we need innovative, cost-effective and decentralised water treatment technologies that can help societies and industries in sustainable water management.”

Residents go with the flow, use smart tech to save water
Water conservation begins at home, in your apartment complex and colonies. You can start with something as simple as installing a low-flow water aerator on taps and showerheads, or recycle waste water to use for gardening, flushing and other quotidian household needs. 
As cities continue to urbanise, demand for fresh water is increasing, it’s hard to keep up supply. Civic bodies do not have adequate water infrastructure, climate change has led to erratic weather patterns. Combine that with mismanaged water resources, wasteful water policies and we have a looming water crisis. 
Waking up to this situation, many residential colonies and individual homes in India are using technology to save water. They are installing smart water meters to track water usage, installing waste-water treatment plants to recycle water in their societies and are even making drinking water out of thin air. 
Flowing uphill
“There are only two ways to solve the water problem,” says Abilash Haridass, co-founder and chief of growth and strategy, WEGoT Utility Solutions. “Either you increase the supply of water or you decrease the demand.” One way to reduce demand is by using water sensors to keep track of water consumption in each household.
In 2017, Bengaluru’s Pearl Tuscany complex, installed WEGoT’s VenAqua water sensor in its 48 apartments. The Chennai-based startup installed sensors in the water inlet of each apartment, helping homes to manage the entire water intake and use by analysing data to track flow, pressure and quality of water in real-time through an mobile phone application.
“The platform can detect leakages and we can remotely shut taps and valves off from our mobile phones. It also tracks abnormal consumption like drips and fixture efficiency and helps buildings become more water efficient,” says Venkatesan Natesan, secretary of the society. He says that their monthly maintenance bill has been reduced by 70 percent. “In 2018 we paid around Rs 2,000 per month, now we barely pay Rs 800 and save 35 percent of water too.” The meter is given out free of cost and residents pay a monthly subscription fee of Rs. 140 for the service.

Indiabulls issued notice by Delhi HC over alleged illegalities and violations
The Delhi High Court on Friday issued a notice to Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd, its subsidiaries and promoters while hearing a petition against the company alleging “illegalities and violations”.
The Division Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued the notice on allegations of misappropriation of funds by Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited.
The petition seeks a direction to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs to conduct an investigation through the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) into the alleged irregularities into the financial affairs of Indiabulls.
The petition also sought direction to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the National Housing Bank (NHB) to investigate the financial affairs and also to direct a special audit of IBHFL. An inquiry by SEBI is also been sought.
It has been alleged that money being loaned out to corporate groups by IBHFL is public money as IBHFL had itself, in the past many years taken huge sums of loans from various public and private banks.
The round-tripping of funds by IBHFL and its promoters is in violation of the relevant laws and policy guidelines and they have also not disclosed sources thereof and their books of account also did not show the true state of affairs.
Indiabulls has issued a statement which states that the PIL filed by Citizens Whistle Blower Forum is a pack of lies motivated by vested interest and has been filed without any research even on publicly available records of the company.
Senior Counsel Mukul Rohtagi and Abhishek Singhvi argued for the Company stated that the false and fabricated allegations made against the Company in respect of loans granted to four business groups fall flat merely on the fact that 2 of these loans to business groups are fully closed with no outstanding dues and loans to 2 other business groups are secured loans granted in the normal course of business and are being serviced regularly as per repayments schedule.
Further, these 2 business groups have no loans or investments of any kind whatsoever in any promoter companies.

What NRIs should watch out for when investing in Indian real estate
When it comes to inward remittance, India tops the global list. According to a World Bank report, Migration and Development Brief, released in April this year, the top remittance recipients include India with $79 billion, followed by China ($67 billion) and Mexico ($36 billion). In fact, it has been on the rise in India, according to data in successive WB reports.
Typically, half of the remittances received by Indian residents are used for maintenance of families, followed by deposits in banks, but a major chunk is also invested in real estate, according to information on Reserve Bank of India (RBI) website. “NRI investments in Indian real estate has doubled from $5 billion in 2014 to $10.2 billion in 2018,” according to a report released in 2018 by 360 Realtors, a consultant firm, on the state of NRI investments in Indian real estate. In fact, nearly 63% NRIs prefer real estate over any other investment in India, shows data from ANAROCK’s consumer sentiment survey for H1 2019.
Though real estate remains a favourite with NRIs, Mint does not recommend investments in this asset class because of concerns such as high transaction cost, illiquidity, delayed construction and the chances of default by the developer. “NRIs should not invest in real estate because of low returns and high risk, unless there is a specific need or they have plans to return to India,” said Rohit Shah, founder and CEO, GettingYouRich, a financial planning firm.
However, given that a lot of NRIs may still go ahead and invest in Indian real estate, especially with the recent rupee depreciation, we list out the segments they should consider and the concerns they should keep an eye on.
Where to invest?
To decide where they can invest in India, NRIs first need to address this question: whether they are buying the property for end use or for investment.
For end use, there are plenty of options, given the slowdown in the sector. “The residential market, specifically, is better placed this year as speculation-led investment activity has reduced significantly. Residential prices have remained stable in most cities over the past few years. Increased transparency in the market and eased investment norms has made the market more attractive for NRIs. Developers too are offering customized solutions for this segment by developing ‘smart’ homes with international appeal,” said Abhinav Joshi, head of research, CBRE India, a real estate consultant.
For investment, the commercial real estate segment may be a better option. “While residential real estate continues to be the ‘first love’ of NRIs, India’s commercial office property asset class presents a profitable alternative for NRI investors. Good capital appreciation and rental yield has increased NRI demand for Grade A offices, IT parks, logistics centres, and now REITs (real estate investment trusts) as well,” said Anuj Puri, chairman, ANAROCK Property Consultants. A good commercial property can give an average rental yield of 6-10% against the current residential property rental yield of 1.5-3.5%, he added.
“Rental yields from residential real estate can be around 2%, and professionally managed commercial property can fetch better returns. But in any case, post tax return can’t be more 7-8% from real estate, so we typically do not recommend,” said Shah.
Rules to watch out for
An NRI can buy any kind of property, except agricultural land. Also, the investment must not violate the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and the Reserve Bank of India regulations.
Payment rules: The payment can be made from funds received in India through normal banking channels or funds held in non-resident ordinary (NRO), non-resident external (NRE) or foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) accounts maintained in India. “NRIs can transfer the money to his or her NRO account in India and pay the seller from there or can also directly transfer the amount to the account of seller in India,” said Amit Maheshwari, partner, Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP, a law firm.
Repatriation rules: According to rules under FEMA, repatriation of proceeds from the sale of a property cannot exceed $1 million in a financial year. However, if the property is inherited or gifted to the NRI, they may repatriate more than $1 million per financial year.
Taxation and other rules: NRIs need to watch out for certain rules when buying, selling or renting out a property. While buying the property, “NRIs need to withhold TDS (tax deducted at source) from the price payable to the seller,” said Maheshwari. NRIs need to deduct TDS at the rate of 1% of the property value, if the property’s value is above Rs 50 lakh.
“On the sale of the asset, the buyer will deduct TDS from the amount payable to the NRI and the NRI can transfer the amount outside India or to his or her NRE account after paying due taxes,” said Maheshwari. TDS rate in this case is 30% (short-term) or 20% (long-term) of the property value.
In case of rental income or capital gains, NRIs are taxed the way resident Indians are. They can even claim deductions available to a resident individual. “An NRI, being an individual gets taxed at the same rate of tax as applicable to an Indian individual. The highest rate of tax shall be 30% and surcharge shall be applicable based on the total income,” said Hemal Mehta, partner, Deloitte India, a tax and audit firm.
Similarly, “capital gains arising from the sale of immovable property shall be taxable at the rate of 20% plus applicable surcharge (it is charged over and above the tax amount, in case the total income exceeds a certain limit) if the same is long-term capital gains, else the rate is 30% plus applicable surcharge,” added Mehta. Investment in real estate is considered long term if it is held for more than two years.
It is as important, or perhaps more, important for NRIs to do their due diligence before investing in real estate as it is for resident Indians. It makes sense to check the property title and the financial health of the builder, especially if you are opting for an under-construction project. Also, keep in mind that real estate is a highly illiquid asset.

Real estate moving towards smaller homes across India: Report
The liquidity crisis in the real estate industry, strict sanctioning of loans by banks and customers’ preference for affordable homes have resulted in developers offering smaller homes in major cities across India. A study released by realty consultant Anarock on Monday said that average apartment sizes have shrunk by 27% over the past five years — from 1,400 square feet in 2014 to nearly 1,020 sq ft in 2019 so far. 
However, what is surprising is that minimum decline (6%) in size of houses has been seen in the national capital region (NCR), which is one of the worst-hit realty markets in the country, the report said. 
According to the Anarock report, while average size of apartments offered for sale across the country came down to 1,020 sq ft, in the NCR the size was 1,390 sq ft. 
Experts said that the reason for reducing sizes of apartment was rising demand for affordable houses among buyers. Anuj Puri, chairman, Anarock Property Consultants, said that buyers increasingly wanted to take benefit of credit subsidy given to affordable housing, which is required to be priced less than Rs 45 lakh and the area should not exceed 60 square metre. “There is also GST benefit for affordable housing as it is fixed at 1% against 5% for mid-segment homes,” said Puri. 
Sanjay Sharma, a Gurugram-based realty consultant, said that the reason sizes have not come down in Delhi-NCR market is that a number of projects had already been launched in 1,500-1,800 sq ft for 2BHKs prior to 2014. “There is also a preference in Gurugram for larger apartments with more facilities and better common areas. Newer projects being launched now might be smaller as per the market demand,” Sharma said. 
The Anarock study says that the NCR saw least decline at 6%, while houses in Chennai went smaller by 8%, and in Bengaluru and Kolkata by 9%. Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune saw highest reduction in size by 45% and 38%, respectively, the report said.

Samajwadi Awas awaiting buyers, GDA  writes to state officials to decide cost of flats
About 1,352 flats constructed under the Samajwadi Awas Yojna, a housing scheme launched under the previous Uttar Pradesh regime, are still waiting for buyers. The Ghaziabad development authority (GDA) has raised this issue with the government to decide the fate of the flats so that they can be disposed of at the earliest. According to official estimates, the pending flats value about Rs 400 crore.
Officials said the disposal of flats is on hold and cannot be put to auction during the regular auction of other unsold properties owned by the GDA. The GDA had constructed 2,563 such flats – 2,267 at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha housing schemes, and 296 at Madhuban Bapudham in 2015.
“Each flat is a 2BHK and the average cost per flat is about Rs 30 lakh. Initially, all 2,267 flats at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha were booked but many buyers later opted for a refund. As of now, we have about 1,056 flats at Koyal Enclave and Indraprastha and all 296 flats under this scheme at Madhuban Bapudhan left with us. Due to this, a lot of revenue inflow is stuck,” said an officer from authority’s property department.
GDA sources said that the authority is stuck on two accounts – one, the same scheme with the name ‘Samajwadi’ may be difficult to launch under the present regime and two, a new scheme with a different name will involve escalation in prices.
“Flats under the Samajwadi scheme were given to allottees after reduction of 3% each of contingency and overhead charges, which are loaded 15% each to the cost of the flats under normal schemes. The Samajwadi scheme has already closed down and the 3% exemption from the charges may not be available anymore. Further, if there is a new scheme launched for the flats, the cost will have to be revised as per current circle rates,” said Kanchan Verma, authority’s vice chairperson.
Officials said they have requested the government to take a call on the matter. They added that the flats cannot be put to auction due to cost issues and this cannot be decided at the local level. Also, any new scheme for the flats will have to be decided by the state government.
“We have written to state officials to decide. The flats under the scheme cannot be disposed of and we cannot put these to auction either. Any direction in this regard will have to be received from state officials,” Verma added.

Further, if there is a new scheme launched for the flats, the cost will have to be revised as per current circle rates,” said Kanchan Verma, authority’s vice chairperson.
Officials said they have requested the government to take a call on the matter. They added that the flats cannot be put to auction due to cost issues and this cannot be decided at the local level. Also, any new scheme for the flats will have to be decided by the state government.
“We have written to state officials to decide. The flats under the scheme cannot be disposed of and we cannot put these to auction either. Any direction in this regard will have to be received from state officials,” Verma added.

US real estate sales to Chinese buyers to hit 8-year low: Report
US home sales to Chinese buyers are likely to drop to an eight-year low in the year ending next March as a prolonged Sino-US trade war hits demand, according to estimates from Chinese real estate website Juwai.com.
Analogous to US portals like Realtor.com and Trulia, Juwai is China’s largest international property website, hosting some 2.8 million listings on both sides of China’s internet censorship mechanism known as the Great Firewall.
Based on its enquiry and buyer data, as well as feedback from industry partners, the site estimated US home sales to Chinese buyers would fall to between $10 billion and $12 billion in the year to March 2020.
While that represents just a fraction of 1% of the $1.6 trillion worth of US homes sold annually, it is down from the $13.4 billion reported for the year ended in March by the National Association of Realtors (NAR) and from more than $30 billion in both 2017 and 2018.
The site’s executive chairman, Malaysian-based German tech entrepreneur Georg Chmiel, said worries over US visas, the weakening yuan and the desire to diversify investments had spurred a collapse in sales to Chinese buyers after a five-year surge.
“The Trump administration’s tariffs, aggressive rhetoric, targeting of Chinese graduate students at US universities, and new visa red tape have all hurt Chinese demand,” he told Reuters.
After a decade of gains against the dollar, China’s yuan currency has fallen 11% in the past 18 months, capped by a devaluation in August which was widely seen as a political move in the trade war and which added to buyers’ concerns.
Chmiel said for Chinese customers US properties served as both financial investments and potential homes for them or for offspring, who they hoped one day would study and work in the United States.
“With the trade war going on, it’s easy to imagine a scenario in which you might be forced to sell or your investment might otherwise lose value,” he said.
California fading
The trend has shown up at US housebuilders this year, with luxury homebuilder Toll Brothers Inc flagging sluggish sales in California, which makes up as much as 30% of its business and is the main target market for Chinese buyers.
The country’s number two builder, Lennar Corp also recently put the blame for soft sales in the state and a western region which accounts for 42% of sales, on fading Chinese demand.
Gay Cororaton, a senior economist at the NAR, did not provide detailed forecasts, but said a slowing Chinese economy and the dollar’s strength were likely to keep pushing down Chinese buying, particularly in prime markets such as California.
“Chinese buyers form a significant portion of international home sales in California, where home prices have been increasing steadily, and that has been one of the factors acting as a deterrent for home purchases, when the yuan has declined,” she said.
“They might look for properties in areas that are less expensive than California, such as Texas and Seattle. And this could put downward pressure on prices in California,” Cororaton said.
Dean Jones, principal and owner at Seattle-based brokerage Realogics Sotheby’s International Realty, said the focus was shifting to “secondary gateway markets” such as Seattle, because of their strong economies and relative affordability.
Jones said Seattle was wooing international buyers with properties selling for a third or half the price of real estate in San Francisco or Los Angeles.
One 41-year old businessman from Tianjin in China, who is looking for properties with a US broker and asked not to be named, told Reuters he hoped the trade war would be resolved soon and that he was considering waiting it out before buying.
“The United States is a livable country where the natural environment, climate, education, medical care, commodity prices are all satisfying,” he said.
“(But) if the trade war keeps intense, it may affect my income and I will probably reduce (my investment).”

In UN building, Donald Trump sees a real estate deal that got away
As President Donald Trump visits the United Nations building in New York this week, he won’t be focused only on the global challenges facing the world body — he’s still reliving the real estate deal there that got away.
More than a decade later, Trump vividly recalls the overtures he made to rebuild the 39-story tower in the early 2000s and posits that he could have done a better job with the $2.3 billion project, which took about three years longer than anticipated and came in more than $400 million over budget.
In the leadup to this week’s UN General Assembly meetings, the president reminisced with reporters on Air Force One this past week about his efforts to win the project.
“I offered to rebuild it at a tiny fraction of what they were going to build it for,” he said.
In 2005, then-developer Trump went before a US Senate committee to complain that the UN was bungling the project. “They don’t know what they want, they don’t know what they have, they don’t know what they’re doing,” Trump said.
He appealed to the panel to let him manage the project. He would even waive his fee, he said. In the end, he didn’t get the project, but his words were music to senators concerned about costs.
“When can you start?” said one appreciative lawmaker, Sen. Mark Dayton, D-Minn., who went on to serve as the state’s governor for two terms.
Trump is scheduled to speak to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. He was asked if he’ll think back to his real estate days when he returns to the UN compound. It sounded like he certainly would.
“I was a very good real estate developer,” he reminisced. He added that he had correctly predicted “It will end up being much more” than expected.
“They didn’t even know what New York steam was versus a boiler,” he said of the developers. “They knew nothing.”
Trump said an ambassador, he believed from Sweden, contacted him to ask how he could have built Trump World Tower, right across the street from the UN compound, for far less than what was envisioned for the smaller U.N. headquarters.
“I said, ‘Because I know how the game is played,’“ Trump recalled.
Trump said he could have completed the project for about $500 million. He would have used marble instead of terrazzo, which is much more expensive, he recalled.
The UN compound was largely built between 1949 and 1952. Over time, it no longer conformed to safety and fire codes, or to security needs. The US provided about $488 million to help pay for the renovations, according to a 2015 Government Accountability Office report.
Trump clearly got a kick out of rehashing the episode. It gave him one more chance to relive his developer days.
“It would have been a great job,” he declared.

Godrej Construction to focus more on infra as realty sector slowdown bites more
The lingering liquidity crisis and demand slowdown in its bread-and-butter real estate business since the past three-four years have resulted in the construction materials business unit of Godrej Construction shifting focus to urban infrastructure, a senior company official has said.
 The construction materials business arm is a strategic business unit of the diversified Godrej & Boyce Mfg Co and is also eyeing a 20 per cent jump in revenue this fiscal to Rs 300 crore from Rs 250 crore last fiscal, Anup Mathew, senior vice-president and business head at Godrej Construction, told PTI.
 “One of the important things we have spotted while the realty sector has been under stress is that the government is focusing a lot more on urban infrastructure now. With increasing budgetary spends, we see good demand for construction materials business going ahead,” he said.
 He said the company has already bagged an order from Metro 3 corridor and three packages from the Metro 4 corridor to supply ready-mix-concrete/such products.
 Godrej Construction offers a wide range of construction materials which include specially engineered ready-mix concrete products, AAC blocks, recycled concrete blocks and pavers for different types of applications.    It also has reduced its supply to real estate developers due to uncertainty on payments, as most players are grappling with liquidity crisis.
 “Earlier we were supplying RMC and recycled concrete products only to the real estate sector. But with the sector going through a difficult phase for the past many years, we changed our strategy to focus on urban infrastructure,” Mathew explains.
 Whether they plan to increase manufacturing capacity, he says, “we would prefer to be asset-light. Our model is to have strategic partnerships with vendors to scale up as and when needed. We can put up our new plants at project sites itself.”   He further says the company wants to concentrate on a few markets like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune where it has its manufacturing facilities.
 However, Mathew notes that when real estate sector revives, their revenue from the construction materials business can also go up and take the total revenue to Rs 500 crore over the next few years.
 Godrej Construction is also into developing modern living spaces and leasing commercial realty space.
